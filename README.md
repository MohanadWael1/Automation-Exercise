# Automation Testing Project

This project is designed to automate test cases for the [Automation Exercise](https://www.automationexercise.com) website. The goal of this project is to create a reliable and maintainable automation framework that covers a variety of test scenarios, including:

- **UI testing** for page elements
- **Functional testing** of core features (e.g., user registration, login, and product search)
- **Validation testing** for form fields and inputs
- **Regression testing** to ensure updates do not break existing functionality
